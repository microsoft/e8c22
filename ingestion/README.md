# Bing Grounding & News Search API

## Description

This FastAPI application provides search endpoints that leverage:

* **Azure AI Project Client and Bing Grounding** for web search and AI agent responses.
* **NewsAPI.org** for retrieving news articles from hundreds of sources.
* **Azure Blob Storage** for storing extracted article content.

The app supports:

* Initializing an AI agent with Bing Grounding, managing threads and messages, and extracting article contents.
* Searching for recent and relevant news headlines and stories using NewsAPI.
* **Uploading extracted article content to Azure Blob Storage** for persistent storage and later retrieval.

---

## Features

* **Bing Search Endpoint:** Accepts a query string and returns search results using Bing Grounding and Azure AI integration.
* **News API Endpoint:** Accepts a query and returns news articles from NewsAPI.
* **Automatic Article Extraction:** Scrapes main article content from URLs returned by Bing or NewsAPI (using `newspaper3k`).
* **Azure Blob Storage Integration:** Extracted article content is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, with metadata for each article.
* **Swagger Docs:** Automatic OpenAPI docs available at `/docs`.

## Azure Authentication & Permissions

This application uses Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) for secure authentication to Azure resources.  

**When running in a Docker container or CI/CD, a Service Principal is recommended.**  

If you deploy this app to Azure (such as Azure Container Instances or Azure Kubernetes Service), use a [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for authentication.  

When running locally as a Docker container, create and use a service principal.  

For local development outside of containers, the Azure SDK will use your Azure CLI credentials (your user principal) by default.

### Service Principal Setup (Recommended for Docker/CI)

1. **Create a Service Principal:**

   ```sh
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "<your-app-name>" --skip-assignment
   ```

   Save the output values for `appId` (client ID), `password` (client secret), and `tenant`.

2. **Assign Permissions:**

   - **Azure AI Resource:**  
     Assign the **Cognitive Services User** role to your service principal.
     - In the Azure Portal, go to your Azure AI resource.
     - Open **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**.
     - Select **Cognitive Services User** and assign it to your service principal.

   - **Azure Storage Account:**  
     Assign the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role to your service principal.
     - In the Azure Portal, go to your Storage Account.
     - Open **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**.
     - Select **Storage Blob Data Contributor** and assign it to your service principal.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Add these to your `.env` file or Docker environment:

   ```
   AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<appId>
   AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<password>
   AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant>
   ```

   When running your container, pass the `.env` file:

   ```sh
   docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 myapp
   ```

---

### Managed Identity (Recommended for Azure-hosted containers)

If you deploy this app to Azure Container Instances, Azure Kubernetes Service, or similar, you can use a [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) instead of a service principal.  
Assign the same roles (**Cognitive Services User** for Azure AI, **Storage Blob Data Contributor** for Storage) to the managed identity.

---

### Local Development

When running locally, the Azure SDK will use your Azure CLI credentials by default (your user principal).  
Make sure you are logged in with:

```sh
az login
```

and have access to the required resources.

---

**Summary of Required Roles:**

| Resource Type         | Role Name                     |
|---------------------- |------------------------------|
| Azure AI Resource     | Cognitive Services User       |
| Azure Storage Account | Storage Blob Data Contributor |

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set required environment variables:**

   For Azure/Bing endpoints:

   ```bash
   export AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="<your_project_connection_string>"
   export BING_CONNECTION_NAME="<your_bing_connection_name>"
   ```

   For NewsAPI:

   ```bash
   export NEWS_API_KEY="<your_newsapi_key>"
   ```

   For Azure Blob Storage:

   ```bash
   export BLOB_ACCOUNT_URL="<your_blob_account_url>"
   export BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME="<your_container_name>"
   # Optionally, if using a connection string:
   export BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="<your_blob_connection_string>"
   ```

   For Azure authentication (Service Principal):

   ```bash
   export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<your_service_principal_appId>"
   export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your_service_principal_password>"
   export AZURE_TENANT_ID="<your_tenant_id>"
   ```

   Optionally, use a `.env` file in your project root (see [dotenv documentation](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)):

   ```
   AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=...
   BING_CONNECTION_NAME=...
   NEWS_API_KEY=...
   BLOB_ACCOUNT_URL=...
   BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME=...
   BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=...

## Azure Blob Storage Integration

When articles are extracted from Bing or NewsAPI results, their main content is **uploaded to Azure Blob Storage**. Each blob is named uniquely and includes metadata such as the article URL and title. This allows for persistent storage and later retrieval of article content.

**Blob Storage Setup:**
- Ensure you have created a blob container in your Azure Storage account.
- Set the required environment variables (`BLOB_ACCOUNT_URL`, `BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME`, and optionally `BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`).
- The application will automatically upload extracted article text to this container.
- **Assign the Storage Blob Data Contributor role to your service principal** for access.

---

## Error Handling

The application logs errors and returns structured error responses for issues during the search process.

---

## Cleanup

For Bing agent searches, the application deletes the created agent and thread after each search to clean up resources.
