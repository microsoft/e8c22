# Bing Grounding & News Search API

## Description

This FastAPI application provides search endpoints that leverage:

* **Azure AI Project Client and Bing Grounding** for web search and AI agent responses.
* **NewsAPI.org** for retrieving news articles from hundreds of sources.
* **Azure Blob Storage** for storing extracted article content.

The app supports:

* Initializing an AI agent with Bing Grounding, managing threads and messages, and extracting article contents.
* Searching for recent and relevant news headlines and stories using NewsAPI.
* **Uploading extracted article content to Azure Blob Storage** for persistent storage and later retrieval.

---

## Features

* **Bing Search Endpoint:** Accepts a query string and returns search results using Bing Grounding and Azure AI integration.
* **News API Endpoint:** Accepts a query and returns news articles from NewsAPI.
* **Automatic Article Extraction:** Scrapes main article content from URLs returned by Bing or NewsAPI (using `newspaper3k`).
* **Azure Blob Storage Integration:** Extracted article content is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, with metadata for each article.
* **Swagger Docs:** Automatic OpenAPI docs available at `/docs`.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with Poetry:**

   If you don't have Poetry installed, install it first:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

   Then install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install   

3. **Set required environment variables:**

   For Azure/Bing endpoints:

   ```bash
   export AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="<your_project_connection_string>"
   export BING_CONNECTION_NAME="<your_bing_connection_name>"
   ```

   For NewsAPI:

   ```bash
   export NEWS_API_KEY="<your_newsapi_key>"
   ```

   For Azure Blob Storage:

   ```bash
   export BLOB_ACCOUNT_URL="<your_blob_account_url>"
   export BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME="<your_container_name>"
   # Optionally, if using a connection string:
   export BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="<your_blob_connection_string>"
   ```

   Optionally, use a `.env` file in your project root (see [dotenv documentation](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)):

   AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=...
   BING_CONNECTION_NAME=...
   NEWS_API_KEY=...
   BLOB_ACCOUNT_URL=...
   BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME=...
   BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=...
   ```

## Azure Blob Storage Integration

When articles are extracted from Bing or NewsAPI results, their main content is **uploaded to Azure Blob Storage**. Each blob is named uniquely and includes metadata such as the article URL and title. This allows for persistent storage and later retrieval of article content.

**Blob Storage Setup:**
- Ensure you have created a blob container in your Azure Storage account.
- Set the required environment variables (`BLOB_ACCOUNT_URL`, `BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME`, and optionally `BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`).
- The application will automatically upload extracted article text to this container.

---

## Error Handling

The application logs errors and returns structured error responses for issues during the search process.

---

## Cleanup

For Bing agent searches, the application deletes the created agent and thread after each search to clean up resources.
